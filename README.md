# OK, Zoomer.

- I want to be able to quickly schedule pre-configured zoom meetings.
  E.g. schedule a lecture, or meetup event
- Have a public (but obfuscated URL) link that can be shared for folks to schedule their own Zoom meetings on my account, e.g. for Cadams to schedule his own open codes
- Pre-configure re-occurring events like scheduled lectures, and automatically include cohort name conventions.

## MVP

At the very least, we need to write some code, that would allow us to programmatically create Zoom events.

- A CLI to create events on the command line?
- Or a web interface

Both would be powered by the same aformentioned code.
